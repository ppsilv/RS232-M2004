# RS232-M2004
This was a project I did for a client a long time ago, unfortunately I don't even remember the client's name anymore, this was the prototype.

Now that I'm retired, I'm playing around with retro electronics, so I decided to revive this project. I did reverse engineering to generate the electrical schematic in Kicad.
The year of this project must have been around 2008.
